      <p>
        Take me down to the river bend<br/>
		Take me down to the fighting end<br/>
		Wash the poison from off my skin<br/>
		Show me how to be whole again<br/><br/>
		
		Fly me up on a silver wing<br/>
		Past the black where the sirens sing<br/>
		Warm me up in the nova's glow<br/>
		And drop me down to the dream below<br/><br/>
		
		'Cause I’m only a crack<br/>
		In this castle of glass<br/>
		Hardly anything there<br/>
		For you to see<br/>
		For you to see<br/><br/>
		
		Bring me home in a blinding dream<br/>
		Through the secrets that I have seen<br/>
		Wash the sorrow from off my skin<br/>
		And show me how to be whole again<br/><br/>
		
		'Cause I’m only a crack<br/>
		In this castle of glass<br/>
		Hardly anything there<br/>
		For you to see<br/>
		For you to see<br/><br/>
		
		'Cause I’m only a crack<br/>
		In this castle of glass<br/>
		Hardly anything else<br/>
		I need to be<br/><br/>
	
		'Cause I’m only a crack<br/>
		In this castle of glass<br/>
		Hardly anything there<br/>
		For you to see<br/>
		For you to see<br/>
		For you to see<br/>
